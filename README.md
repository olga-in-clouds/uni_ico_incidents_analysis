# Analysis and Reporting Project

This repository contains data analysis work for the Analysis and Reporting university module.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory for storing data files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization
- `src/`: Source code for reusable functions and utilities
- `output/`: Directory for storing analysis results and generated figures
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Place your data files in the `data/` directory and use either Python scripts in `src/` or Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for analysis.
